This project showcases a loading animation that spells out the word "LOADING" with an accompanying moving bar. The animation is styled using CSS and is responsive for various screen sizes. There is also a link to a YouTube channel at the bottom for subscribers.

## Demo

The loading animation consists of characters that move up and down while a bar slides across the bottom. Once the loading is complete, you can click the link to subscribe to the YouTube channel.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the loading animation.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the loading animation and the YouTube link.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the loading animation.
